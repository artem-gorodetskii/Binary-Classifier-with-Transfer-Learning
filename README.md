## Transfer-Learning-Test-Project
This  project represents TensorFlow implimentation of CNN binary classifier using transfer learning technique. 
The model allows to distingwish images containing Saint George with accurocy 94.0%. It was trained on Tesla K80 GPU (Kaggle).
# Project_Structure
* 'load_data.ipynb' file allows to download images and separate then on training and validation datasets (70/30 %).
* 'train_classifier.ipynb' file contains TensorFlow implimentation of the model and its training  process.
